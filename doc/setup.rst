Using Our Server
----------------
* Visit https://api.picar.us/wearscript/, click "authenticate", then sign-in using your Google acccount
* Contact brandyn in #openshades on IRC freenode to be white-listed (you must authenticate before we can add you)
* After being whitelisted you can continue "Connecting the Client to the Server"

Install Server
--------------
* Linux is highly recommended, we have not tested this on OSX or Windows (feel free to try)
* The video below gives a step by step guide
* A few "alternate" options are listed below that may be useful if you run into problems
* Tested on Ubuntu 13.04, if you want support it helps if you stick with this or a new Ubuntu if possible.
* Ubuntu packages: apt-get install golang git mercurial redis-server
* Setup the config.go file (look at config.go.example)
* Run /server/install.sh (this does basic dependencies and such)
* Start with ./server and continue with "Connecting the Client to the Server"

Alternate: Installing Go (manually)
------------------------
* wget https://go.googlecode.com/files/go1.1.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
* tar -xzf go1.1.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
* Put "export GOROOT=<yourpath>/go" and "export GOPATH=<yourpath>/gocode" in your .bashrc
* The "gocode" is where packages will be stored and "go" is the location of the extracted folder.

Alternate: Install Redis
------------------
* Follow instructions here http://redis.io/download (tested on 2.6.*)

Install WearScript VM (Client + Server)
---------------------------------------
* Get the WearScript source (see above)
* Get/install Vagrant (go here http://downloads.vagrantup.com/ get the newest version for your platform)
* In a terminal run: vagrant box add saucy64 http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/vagrant/saucy/current/saucy-server-cloudimg-amd64-vagrant-disk1.box
* Enter the wearscript/vagrant directory, and run "vagrant up" (takes about 10 minutes)
* You now have: Ubuntu 13.10, Android Studio, all client/server dependencies, and a fresh copy of WearScript inside.
* Use "vagrant ssh" to enter the VM (if you launch a graphical program such as Android Studio it will start in your native window environment)
* Client: Follow "Install Client (source)" above (starting with importing "wearscript/glass" as a new project)
* Server: Follow the "Install Server" above (starting from setting up config.go)

Connecting the Client to the Server
-----------------------------------
* Go to the server in Chrome (please use Chrome, it is easier for us to support)
* Click "authenticate", then sign-in using your Google acccount
* Click QR, then either
  * Paste the adb command while Glass is plugged connected to USB
  * Select WearScript (setup) and scan the QR code
* Open WearScript (start) using Launchy while you have the webapp open, you should see the cube/table pop up and buttons enable on the bottom.
